#TO-DO:

* Find instances where flash would
be appropriate and correspondingly put
them in.

* Fix the issue where the login/logout
icons cannot be seen when the page is 
shrunk.

* Add Profile functionality:
    * Let users change their name,
      see all their postings, and
      possibly even see a news 
      feed of all their followed
      posters to see what they're 
      posting.
      
      
 * Add authentication for delete.
 * Find out how to make it so that users can only see the delete and edit buttons depending on their logged in.
 Integrate the comment-add page to the main show page. 
 
 * Add proper error information and redirection in the event that a user attempts to login with incorrect 
 information.
